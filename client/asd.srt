No, this might.

354
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:51,597
What is this?

355
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:52,798
It's a paper that I wrote

356
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,299
my sophomore year at Georgetown.

357
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,401
'Each of us had to do a case
study on a unique murder'

358
00:15:56,503 --> 00:15:57,636
'and I did mine on a woman who was killed'

359
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:59,204
'on her wedding night.'

360
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,206
Did you know that it's human
instinct to go head first

361
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:02,775
when you leap to your death?

362
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:04,976
- No.
- 'Well, it is.'

363
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,344
(Spencer) 'And later on,
they discovered that her neck'

364
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,946
was broken before she fell.

365
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,514
She was found holding her bridal bouquet

366
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:11,683
and her fingernails were wiped clean.

367
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:14,652
- What class was this for?
- It's for criminology.

368
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,721
Look, that's exactly the
way that Charlotte died.

369
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,656
What if somebody knows
that I wrote this paper

370
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:20,391
they know my history here and
they're trying to set me up?

371
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:22,759
Spence, breathe.

372
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,962
Being back here is making you paranoid.

373
00:16:25,997 --> 00:16:28,431
Nobody's trying to hurt you, okay?

374
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:30,834
I'm telling you...

375
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,604
This is all just one big coincidence.

376
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,873
I don't think the police
are gonna see it that way.

377
00:16:35,974 --> 00:16:37,673
[intense music]

378
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,610
You told me you had a
relationship with this person.

379
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,913
Ezra Fitz was my high
school English teacher.

380
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:50,716
And he told you he's gonna
give the advance back?

381
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:53,985
Well... he said he's thinking about it.

382
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:56,488
You heard about what
happened to his girlfriend.

383
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:59,023
He's not in a good place right now.

384
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,759
No writer is ever in a good place, Aria.

385
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,197
I thought the teacher
angle would help but perhaps

386
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:06,431
that's the problem.

387
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:08,333
Maybe Fitz isn't taking you seriously

388
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,501
'because you were his student.'

389
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:12,736
Liam, I want you to take over.

390
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,672
- Take over?
- Uh...

391
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:17,374
Jillian, it's not Aria's fault.

392
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:18,709
'She went to testify at this hearing'

393
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,244
'and there was a
murder in this town... '

394
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:21,912
Liam's right.

395
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,549
I just, I got really distracted

396
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,984
but it won't happen again.

397
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:29,852
Jillian, I know this author.

398
00:17:29,953 --> 00:17:32,188
I can get through to him
better than anyone else.

399
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,224
This isn't personal, Aria.

400
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:38,027
I just want somebody to bring
back the book we paid for.

401
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,029
Liam, you can stay.

402
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:42,665
[dramatic music]

403
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,943
[instrumental music]

404
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:01,949
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Hey, hi.

405
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,385
- Do you have a sec?
- Sure.

406
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:08,022
Um, Ezra says that you
manage the place now.

407
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:11,125
He put me in charge when he
and Nicole went to Colombia.

408
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:13,528
They thought it'd be a month long thing.

409
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,263
Hell of a way to get promoted.

410
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:19,332
Yeah. Well, I won't keep you.

411
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:23,102
I just wanted to stop
by and ask you a favor.

412
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,638
Sure.

413
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,507
Um... could you not tell anyone

414
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,843
that you saw me outside at
the medical center today?

415
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,246
I'm not quite sure who I would tell.

416
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,614
I know, it's just my
mom comes here sometimes

417
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,683
and my friends and...

418
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,085
Yeah. I won't say anything.

419
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,422
Thanks.

420
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,858
Emily...

421
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,195
I had cancer...

422
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,730
Several years ago.

423
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,030
I didn't want people to know.

424
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,399
I didn't want them to think of me

425
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,133
as the sick girl with cancer.

426
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,470
But I learned the hard way you need support

427
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,440
when you're going through
something like that.

428
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,842
I don't know what I would
have done without my family

429
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,011
my friends.

430
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,479
I don't wanna make assumptions
about what you're going through.

431
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,815
No, I'm, I'm sorry, you
had to deal with that

432
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,783
but I'm fine.

433
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:17,387
And the last thing I need to do...

434
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,690
Is to give my mom
something else to worry about.

435
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,427
Okay.

436
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,061
Okay.

437
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:31,234
- Hi.
- Oh, wow.

438
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:33,603
- You guys bring enough food?
- Oh, there's more.

439
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,004
Hey, Hanna. Hi, Jordan.

440
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:37,573
- 'Hey, Jordan.'
- 'Hey.'

441
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:39,742
- 'So good to see you.'
- You too.

442
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:44,746
Uh, Jordan, this is Caleb. Caleb, Jordan.

443
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:46,481
I finally get to meet the Caleb Rivers.

444
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:47,749
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

445
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,016
Any chance you wanna help me get

446
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:50,418
the last load of food from the car?

447
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,953
Uh, yeah. How much did you guys bring?

448
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,356
[chuckles] I know. I
come from a big family.

449
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:56,258
Always over-order.

450
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,992
[instrumental music]

451
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:02,028
They'll be fine.

452
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,733
- How are you doing?
- I'm holding up, I guess.

453
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,868
I'm glad everyone could make it...

454
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,637
Except for Aria.

455
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:11,272
Has anyone talked to her?

456
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,240
Uh, not since she left.

457
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:14,608
Yeah, I've called her a few times.

458
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,943
She hasn't returned my calls.

459
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:19,044
She's probably just busy with work.

460
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:22,114
What are you doing?

461
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,016
I was just gonna make some room.

462
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:26,286
I bought those for Charlotte
to welcome her home.

463
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,790
(Emily) Spence.

464
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:33,259
Okay. Well, then the
flowers can stay there.

465
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,395
I'll go get some serving spoons.

466
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,898
[music continues]

467
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:42,467
[sighs]

468
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:47,172
That was weird.

469
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:48,607
[whispering] Yeah,
maybe she knows about us.

470
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,141
This is her way of pitting
us against each other.

471
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:52,510
I don't know. I think
she just wants her pages.

472
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:54,912
We can figure this out.

473
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:56,814
If Fitz isn't taking you
seriously, then I'll go...

474
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,783
That's not the issue.

475
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,018
Then-then what is?

476
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:05,523
Aria.

477
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:08,692
Wh-what's going on?

478
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:10,026
[instrumental music]

479
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:12,862
Ezra Fitz is not the
same person that you met

480
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:14,464
on his book tour two years ago.

481
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,500
But I am gonna talk to Jillian

482
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:20,303
and I'm gonna convince her
to give me another shot.

483
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,004
Yeah, you should.

484
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,006
Just duck if she picks up the phone, okay?

485
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:26,842
[music continues]

486
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,611
[sighs]

487
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,547
- For how long?
- 'Couple of weeks.'

488
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:32,614
Maybe a month.

489
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:34,149
My mom asked me to stick around

490
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,983
for a while.

491
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:36,485
The Salk Institute won't mind?

492
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:39,054
No.

493
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:41,323
What do you do there?

494
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:43,791
Um, we research cures.

495
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:46,661
Alzheimer's, diabetes

496
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:48,596
infectious diseases.

497
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:49,797
Damn.

498
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:52,700
Well, you'll save 'em, I'll dress 'em.

499
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,869
Oh, perfect.

500
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,572
And I think it goes in this way.

501
00:21:57,673 --> 00:22:00,006
[exhales deeply]

502
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:01,441
God, there's four bottles of wine

503
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,942
and nobody can find a wine opener.

504
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:04,611
This is not happening.

505
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,981
Uh, it's actually, it's backwards.

506
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:09,850
I used to have one just like it.

507
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,284
You kinda have to angle the leaves down.

508
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:13,253
Oh, the one with the scratch on it?

509
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:14,888
Yeah, it's the first piece of furniture

510
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:16,655
we put into the new place.

511
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:18,891
Hanna wouldn't let go of it.

512
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:20,325
- Caleb?
- Yeah.

513
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:22,428
Um, I can't find any wine glasses.

514
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:23,729
You wanna go check the pantry for me?

515
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,464
Yeah.

516
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,100
Nice.

517
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:30,536
So do you and Caleb see
much of each other in DC?

518
00:22:31,337 --> 00:22:32,638
Uh, yeah, we do.

519
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:35,306
I mean, I don't really see much
of anybody except for my phone.

520
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:36,974
But of all the people that I don't see

521
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:38,943
I don't see Caleb the most.

522
00:22:39,044 --> 00:22:40,745
Or the least.

523
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:42,179
Uh, it's nice you keep in contact.

524
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,949
I barely see any of my
friends from high school.

525
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,084
Oh, we didn't, uh, for a while.

526
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:49,987
And then we ran into each other in Madrid.

527
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:51,488
It was crazy. It was a total fluke.

528
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:53,290
I was just finishing my year abroad

529
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:55,626
and he was backpacking through Europe.

530
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,428
I was about to get on a train in Salamanca

531
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:00,263
and I heard my name and I looked up

532
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:02,933
and he was just standing there

533
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:04,835
on the opposite platform.

534
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,237
Wow. That sounds amazing.

535
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,540
Yeah, it was.

536
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,710
Oh, hey.

537
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:16,579
Hi.

538
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,014
Have you seen any wine glasses?

539
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:20,950
Ali de-boozifed the place when she thought

540
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,319
Charlotte was coming home.

541
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,921
But I'll help you find the wine glasses

542
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:27,823
if you help me find an opener.

543
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:29,524
Deal.

544
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,160
[music continues]

545
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,033
Jordan seems nice.

546
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:40,969
He is.

547
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,503
Uh, congrats on your engagement.

548
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,405
I-I meant to say that yesterday. Sorry.

549
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,240
Thank you.

550
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:51,612
- So you kept the table?
- Of course, I did.

551
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:54,247
[music continues]

552
00:23:57,652 --> 00:24:00,219
Look, when you left for Europe...

553
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,922
I wanted to focus on my career.

554
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:04,991
I wasn't looking for another relationship.

555
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:10,530
You seem happy.

556
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:12,565
I am.

557
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm glad.

558
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:17,035
[instrumental music]

559
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,641
Uh, found them.

560
00:24:23,843 --> 00:24:25,978
Looks like we got what we need.

561
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:31,550
(Alison) 'Thank you. I, uh,
I appreciate you calling.'

562
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:36,053
Ali, who was that?

563
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:38,689
Lorenzo. He said he'd
call with any updates.

564
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:44,161
- What was it? The update?
- Time of death.

565
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,698
Charlotte was killed around 4:00 a.m.

566
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,666
Are you okay?

567
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:52,702
Lorenzo says this is good news.

568
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:55,739
They're one step closer
to finding her killer.

569
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:06,482
Let's say grace.

570
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,254
Hanna, hand.

571
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,593
Thank you, Heavenly Father

572
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:20,128
for this healing food
and these dear friends

573
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,631
and thank you to all those
who are working tirelessly

574
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:24,498
'to seek justice for Charlotte.'

575
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,703
And thank you for helping the
police find Charlotte's killer

576
00:25:28,804 --> 00:25:32,339
and anyone who could be
protecting him or her.

577
00:25:33,642 --> 00:25:36,844
'Thank you always for
your guidance and love.'

578
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:39,080
Amen.

579
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,314
(all) 'Amen.'

580
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,815
Amen.

581
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,084
[intense music]

582
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,834
[sighs] That was awkward.

583
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:53,771
Was that speech directed at us?

584
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:56,906
Not at us but... Aria maybe.

585
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:59,142
Why would Ali think that
Aria had anything to do

586
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:01,144
with Charlotte's death?

587
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,045
Maybe she did.

588
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:05,614
Aria left the hotel the
night that she was killed.

589
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:08,417
- How do you know this?
- I saw her.

590
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:12,221
She left around 3:00 a.m. and
I don't know when she got back.

591
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,522
- Let's just ask her.
- Well, I tried that.

592
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,958
She denied going anywhere but her car.

593
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,394
Okay, well, there are
surveillance cameras, right

594
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,495
in the lobby of the hotel?

595
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:23,064
- Yeah.
- Your mom's the manager.

596
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,332
So maybe you could find a way

597
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,600
to get a look at the
footage from that night.

598
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:28,136
No. I'm don't do stuff like that anymore.

599
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:30,905
Hanna, I know it's a lot to ask, okay?

600
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,339
But how else are we supposed to make sure

601
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,942
that Aria came back before Charlotte died?

602
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:37,577
[intense music]

603
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,614
How's Alison doin'?

604
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:44,651
Um, she's dealing... in her own Ali way.

605
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:46,620
Well, I'm sure it helps having you around.

606
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,055
Showing there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.

607
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:51,925
[cellphone vibrates]

608
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:54,627
Hollis Medical Center? Wait,
you have an appointment?

609
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:57,096
Um...

610
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,098
- Are you feeling okay?
- I'm fine.

611
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,400
I-it's just an interview, um...

612
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:03,870
For grad school.

613
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:06,538
Grad school at Hollis?

614
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:08,907
Oh, why didn't you tell
me you were applying?

615
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:11,609
I'm just exploring my options.
I mean, honestly it's...

616
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:14,446
The institute just
wanted me to look into it.

617
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:15,780
Wow.

618
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:17,983
Okay.

619
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,417
So what are you thinking?

620
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:22,553
I mean, you've always
talked about sports medicine.

621
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:25,323
You know who you should
talk to? Aunt Kathy.

622
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:27,424
She's a nurse practitioner.

623
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:29,827
- Right?
- Here you go, ladies.

624
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,263
Let me know if you need anything else.

625
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:37,801
You know, honey, if you're
worried about paying for it

626
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:39,469
you shouldn't be.

627
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,272
Dad left you all that money
for exactly this reason

628
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:45,441
and you can just take
out a loan for the rest.

629
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,377
You know, all the work you're doing

630
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:49,545
the person you've become

631
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:52,349
your dad would be really
proud of you, Emmy.

[knock on door]

636
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,833
Hey.

637
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:18,439
(Ezra) I wasn't expecting anyone.

638
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,044
I thought you went back to Boston.

639
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:24,545
I did.

640
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:26,414
I flew back to talk to you.

641
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:28,950
Oh! Well, you could've called.

642
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:31,851
My boss has this thing
about how it's harder

643
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:34,054
to say no in person.

644
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:35,722
This is about the book.

645
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,961
Drink?

646
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,830
No, thank you.

647
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:50,202
They won't take back the advance.

648
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,405
Ah! So they are mad.

649
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,506
N-not mad.

650
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,143
They just loved "Ostinato."

651
00:28:57,244 --> 00:28:59,145
Well, it made them money.

652
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:01,213
It made them feel things.

653
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:02,982
It's a really good book, Ezra

654
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,184
and I am not just saying
that to flatter you. It is.

655
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:08,820
I promise you they are not
going to love the follow-up.

656
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:15,860
(Aria) 'That's it? That's the book?'

657
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,795
It's as far as I got.

658
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:20,798
Can I look at it?

659
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:29,506
Hey, first draft is a first draft.

660
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,608
I'm sure it's not that bad.

00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:41,750
That night after we saw each other

663
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:44,520
after I went back to the
hotel where did you go?

664
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:47,723
What are you asking me?

665
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:49,959
You know what I'm asking you.

666
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,097
Where did you go?

00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,298
[music continues]

668
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,900
Home, Aria.

669
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:00,902
I went home.

670
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:03,538
[music continues]

671
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:10,465
Spence, stop worrying about the paper.

672
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:12,534
You gotta let it go.

673
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:19,240
Are you sure you're okay
sleeping on the couch again?

674
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:20,976
Yeah, totally.

675
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:23,744
It's a lot more comfortable
than those hostel beds in Europe.

676
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,314
Can you believe that it's been three years

677
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:29,917
since we were in Madrid?

678
00:30:30,018 --> 00:30:31,685
[chuckles] That's crazy.

679
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,086
I don't think I'm ever gonna forgive you

680
00:30:33,187 --> 00:30:35,322
for dragging me to that awful bullfight.

681
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:37,224
Come on, it was not that awful.

682
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:38,592
It-it was awful when you started screaming

683
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:39,726
"Savages" at the drunk crowd.

684
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,327
It was terrible from the beginning.

685
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,529
That's why I was screaming.

686
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,930
- It was awful.
- 'Okay.'

687
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:46,332
- You made me cry.
- I didn't make you do anything.

688
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,334
You didn't stop me from
crying in the street.

689
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:49,903
You were, you were pretty livid.

690
00:30:50,004 --> 00:30:51,237
It was not okay.

691
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:52,438
But, hey, I redeemed myself

692
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,206
when I snuck us into Retiro Park

693
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:56,409
with a couple bottles of Sangria.

694
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,976
Yeah, you did.

most beautiful sunrise.

Yeah.

698

Stick around and help with the campaign.

705
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:32,776
That's a great idea.

712
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:54,063
There she is.

00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:56,999
(Hanna) 'It's 3:12.'

714
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,367
What the hell was Ezra doing there?

715
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,472
So much for just going to her car.

but there's a cleaning crew

718
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,610
down the hall.

719
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:10,878
- Okay, hurry.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

720
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,115
- What did I miss?
- Aria left the hotel with Ezra.

721
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:15,282
What?

722
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:17,151
But she didn't come back with him.

What time did Ali say
that Charlotte was killed?

726
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,691
Close to 4:00.

727
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,526

after the time of murder'

had anything to do with it.

We're not in high school, Emily.

733
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,467
We're gonna talk to Aria.

734
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:36,369
She won't tell us anything.

I saw you visiting Ezra.

739
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:52,217
We know you saw him the
night Charlotte died.

740
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:55,021
We know you left the hotel
for more than five minutes.

741
00:32:55,122 --> 00:32:57,789
Yeah, and by the time you came
back Charlotte was already dead.

742
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,125
It's time to tell us what
really happened that night.

743
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:03,828
You didn't have to come by.

744
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:05,930
Well, you said you couldn't sleep.

745
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:07,465
Ugh, I can't.

746
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:11,435
I just keep going over
what I said to the judge.

747
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,071
God, that look on Ali's face.

748
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:15,338
Look, what you said

749
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,708
was honest and brave.

750
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:18,976
So if your friends are
giving you a hard time...

751
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:20,577
No, no, no, no.

752
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,079
They're not... at all.

753
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,415
They'd actually wish that
they'd said the same thing.

754
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:27,350
I mean, that's the crazy part.

755
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:31,020
I-I just thought if one of us had said no

756
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:33,389
then that would just be the end of it.

757
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:36,893
Yeah, me too.

758
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:40,596
Hey, can we go somewhere?

759
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,965
Anywhere but here.

760
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:44,967
Of course.

(Aria) Mm, why is everything closed?

763

It's suburban Pennsylvania
and about 4:00 a.m.

764
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:54,876
Yeah, I want pizza.

765

Doesn't anybody care that I want pizza?

768

It's closed, but I
happen to know the owner.

770
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:11,058
No, no, I should go. It's late.

771
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,761
Yeah, sure.

00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:19,266

774
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:22,869
I think that's Charlotte.

775
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,171
Do we call someone? Do we call the police?

776
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,740
No, Aria. She's free now.

777
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:28,574
It's her town now as much as ours.

778
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:31,111
Oh, she's free and she's
already lurking in the shadows.

779
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:33,079

kind of world we live in.

and Charlotte gets to walk free.

783
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:44,123
Hey, are you okay?

784
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,827
Yeah. You know, it's-it's getting late.

785
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:51,396
You should probably get back to your hotel.

786
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:53,565
Yeah.

787
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:58,435
Goodnight.

788
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:01,072
[dramatic music]

789
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:10,214
He told me he went home afterwards.

790
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:12,082
But... I don't know.

791
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:13,984
He-he was so angry.

792
00:35:15,153 --> 00:35:18,688
- Aria, what is it?
- I know him.

793
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,291
And I know that Ezra can't
look me in the eye when he lies.

794
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:24,394
And when he told me he
went home, he didn't...

795
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:26,396
Look at me.

796
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,498
[sighs] Well, we have to tell someone.

797
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,766
- Lorenzo, Ali, anyone.
- No, we don't.

798
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:31,901
Now, this is a giant leap.

799
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:34,369
We're talking about Ezra killing someone.

800
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,704
I mean, until we have actual proof

801
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:37,072
we don't tell anyone anything.

802
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:38,674
It's not.

[music continues]

804
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:42,978
It's not a giant leap.

805
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:47,949
In fact, I think I told Ezra how to do it.

806
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,220
Ezra was on his book tour and

807
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:54,989
we got together for lunch.

808
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,390
He was still trying to
figure out what he wanted

809
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:58,092
to write next and he said
that he was toying around

810
00:35:58,193 --> 00:35:59,927
with the idea of a murder mystery.

811
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:01,796
I had just written my paper so I told him

812
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:03,830
about the case in detail.

813
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:06,933
Maybe Ezra did do this to protect you.

814
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,502
Protect me?

815
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:11,538
By copying some bizarre
murder from the past?

816
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,139
Spencer, this was a public case.

817
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,841
You weren't the only two who knew about it.

818
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,944
He saw how upset Aria was in the courtroom.

819
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,712
And he's still angry about
what happened to Nicole.

820
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,146
I mean, who knows what he's capable of now?

821
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:24,216
If he did kill Charlotte
and the police find out...

822
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,952
It's gonna look like
you were involved too.

823

You left the hotel with Ezra
and you came back a half hour

824
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:31,891

825
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,961

Why did you show this to me?

828
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,842
I wanted you to know that I wrote it.

829
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,343
Somebody from my class could remember it

830
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,412
and read about Charlotte
and connect the dots.

831
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,347
What dots?

832
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,450
Do you know anything about
what happened to Charlotte?

833
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,686
- No.
- Then I'm not worried.

834

You haven't. And it won't.

- How?

already be diffused.
